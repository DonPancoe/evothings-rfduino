# rfduino-evothings

Updated to add the ability to read and subscribe to a characteristic. 

Add a little jquery to app to hide/show buttons at different times. 

***Disclamer***
This seems to work but use at your own risk. If anyone sees anything wrong I'd like to hear about it. 

From DonPancoe: learning to use Github at the same time I explore MarcGraham's evothings-rfduino repository. No specific ideas yet on improvements I can contribute.
